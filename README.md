# ExtraCredit

What was the extra work?:

For my extra credit project, I created a program that demonstrates the concepts from HW10 Question 6 about EQCFG being co-Turing recognizable. The program demonstrates how recognizable languages work, how co-recognizable languages work, and why some languages cannot be decided. It uses a simple string comparison as a comparison to show these complex concepts. 

Why I chose this project:

I chose this project because it focuses on recent class material and HW10 Question 6, which introduced the concept of EQCFG being co-Turing recognizable but not decidable. This project allowed me to explore the differences between recognizable and co-recognizable languages. By implementing this code, I gained a clearer understanding of how Turing machines handle problems that are recognizable but not decidable. It helped me see why some problems, like checking CFG equivalence, canâ€™t always give a yes/no answer. This made the theoretical concepts from class more concrete.

What files are what:

3 files: 
 - Language_recognizer.py => main program that implements both an equality recognizer and an inequality recognizer.
 - test_cases.txt => contains pairs of strings that we can test with our recognizers
 - README.txt => explains the project and its connection to the course
